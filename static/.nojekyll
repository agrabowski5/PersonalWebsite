## Update Your Build and Deploy Script

If you're using GitHub Actions, make sure your workflow sets the base path:

```yaml
<vscode_codeblock_uri>file:///c%3A/Users/agrab/OneDrive%20-%20Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology/Personal/Personal_Website/.github/workflows/deploy.yml</vscode_codeblock_uri>name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      # No need for BASE_PATH env variable now as it's hardcoded
      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: build
